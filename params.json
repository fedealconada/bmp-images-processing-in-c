Then, according to the parameters that the programme receives, it will invoke to different functions associated to the parameters.\r\n\r\nHOW TO USE IT:\r\n-------\r\n\r\n-h: o -?: shows a menu about how to run the script.\r\n\r\n-s: shows information about the header of the BMP. If no other option is specified (except -i), it won't save any output file.\r\n\r\n-p: vertical flip.\r\n\r\n-r: rotates the matrix 90 degrees.\r\n\r\n-n: inverts image colours.\r\n\r\n-d: duplicates the image size.\r\n\r\n-f: reduces image size to half.\r\n\r\n-b RATIO: blur effect with RATIO pixels.\r\n\r\n-lh WIDTH SPACE COLOR: draws horizontal lines of specified colour with specified width pixels, separated by SPACE pixels.\r\n\r\n-lv WIDTH SPACE COLOR: draws vertical lines of specified colour with specified width pixels, separated by SPACE pixels.\r\n\r\n-o OUTPUT: specifies the name of the file in which the output image will be stored. If the name is not specified, out.bmp will be used.\r\n\r\n-i INPUT: name of the file with the image that you want to process. This argument MUST exists.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe programme made work in Linux but in Windows has some bugs. ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
